 * Write versions of the cat_dot() s from the previous exercises to take
 * C-style strings as arguments and return a free-store-allocated C-style string
 * as the result. Do not use standard library functions or types in the im-
 * plementation. Test these functions with several strings. Be sure to free
 * (using delete ) all the memory you allocated from free store (using new ).
 * Compare the effort involved in this exercise with the effort involved for
 * exercises 5 and 6.
